# sample-portfolio

Motivation was to improve funcationalaity of CSS flex boxes with focus on the box module, position values and media queries for different consoles. The code for HTML was done entirely from scratch implementing basics to deploy an application to web browsers and standard functionality via semantics and organised style sheet. Alternative attributes were applied for accesability. 

Improvements and skills learned were google fonts for style, more use of classes, and notes added to portions of the page for the use of potentional future coders or oneself to understand reasoning for certain code. 

I researched and was able to apply opening links in new tabs, opening a new email from local app and delivering a telephone call. 

Challenges were applying the hover psuedo element and aligning flex boxes with the work section and the footer. Discovering how to use absolute/relative position writing affective code to deploy website successfully, whilst noticing if any redundant code was apparent.

## Changes made

## HTML 
Jump links, images cropped for size, making sure there were enough containers to apply classes to to style the sheet. 

## CSS
Using gloabl tag would impliment style to same element, needing to create anough classes to style the different sections in there own way. The attempt at the hover psuedo element is in the style sheet however is commented out as was unsuccessful. 

## MEDIA QUERIES
Screen sizes are for two desktop views, tablet view and smartphone views. Troubles occured with the footer and the desktop views mainting the margin of the Contact Me title of the seciton causing the solid border go in and out of line depending on pixel view size. Header also restyled from flex row when down to tablet/smartphone.

## AS AN employer*
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria*
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. *
